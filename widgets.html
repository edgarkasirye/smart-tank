                <h1>The Story of the Lollipops</h1>

                Funny that a programming group is called that, but that is to depict the absolute unpredictability of the group. Well it's also a name of an android version of an operating system. 
          </p>
                The team is made of students of Computer Science in proceeding to their second year. It was brought together by the team leader Petrina Tusubira.
                They have been friends and classmates for more than a year now.
                The idea was first suggested by Kasirye Edgar and later refurbished by the team and the wise counsel of the lecturers.
                The team has been commended for their heartless work towards the project, leaving campus sometimes late in the night and waking up in the wee hours of the day to accomplish the work.
              </p>
                But it was not all work without play, it has been a memorable experience to work with the team, stress limits have been tested, behaviors under pressure have been brought forth, jokes and laughter filled the work space to relieve stress, friendships and relationships have been mended not to mention 'chemistries' have been sparked.
             <br/>
                We have learnt more about each other in the last couple of weeks than we could have in past year. We are grateful and hope to do more work together. We even had fights about our name the “lollipops”.
                I recommend the team for any work that life has to throw at them. We are The Lollipops.
              </p>
                Yours,
                <br/>
                Edgar Kasirye.
